# CondoPricesAnalysis

In this project, we do web scraping for a website and perform some analysis on the acquired data to find intelligence:
1. Use urllib to retireve condos information from condos.ca
2. Use beautifulsoup to parse the HTML results and extract condo prices
3. Compare the condo prices in different regions

Analysis Results:
